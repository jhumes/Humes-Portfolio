# Outline - Overview

I self reported data regarding my weight loss efforts and some other variables during two periods of my life:
1. The fall and winter of 2016-2017
2. The spring and summer of 2019

Both of these efforts were successful, but had differing characteristics:
- Period 1 was much more strict about tracking my calories, less focused on routine exercise.
- Period 2 was more lax on calorie counting (I didn't use a tracking app) but had a much more strict exercise schedule. It also collected a lot more variables, such as the amount of sleep I got, the weather, etc.

By comparing these two periods, I want to convince the audience that a strict calorie counting using a tool (like MyFitnessPal, etc.) as well as a strict exercise routine will yield the best, most predictable weight loss results. In general, Period 1 demonstrates why tracking app are useful, and period 2 demonstrates the importance of frequent exercise. I also want to show particular habits about myself (days in which I tended to eat more, getting enough sleep, etc.) that might reveal themselves as something to be aware of or something to control when trying to lose weight, which can be achieved using the additional variables I collected in period 2.
