# Storyboard (Pre-feedback)
Below is the orginal storyboard I drafted before conducting any feedback interviews.

The storyboard shows the general flow of my story, whereas the wireframes (up next) are the visualization blown up and in more detail.

# Wireframes (Pre-feedback)

Below are the original wireframes in the order that they appear in the storyboard above.

# User Research

Goals:

- Determine if the data is presented clearly and meaning is easy to grasp
- Determine if the visualizations are convincing
- Determine if the meanings of the visualizations contribute meaningfully to the overall objective/call to action
- Determine if the elements of the story are presented logically
- Determine if the reader is convinced by the call to action overall

Target Audience: The general public, i.e. anyone. Since anyone can have trouble losing weight, the story needs to be accessible to anyone, regardless of knowledge base.

Interviewee Selection: To simulate a wide knowledge base, I chose interviewees among family and peers with a varying degrees of education and knowledge base, some of whom who have tried to lose weight before.

Visualization/Wireframe Questions
The following questions will be asked sequentially for each visualization of each wireframe.

Script and Responses

Q1: "What does this visualization mean to you?"

In general, all interviewees quickly and correctly identified the meaning of all of the visualizations, except for the initial weight loss summary chart. While I intended for this to give summary information about each period, respondents interpreted it as a compare and contrast scenario between the two periods.

Q2: "How easy is it to determine the meaning of the visualization?"

Consensus of the responses:
- summary chart: unclear
- exercise: very easy
- cheat day: very easy
- tracker: easy

Q3: "What would make the interpretation of the visualization more clear?"
- summary chart: Make the losses positive; Keep only the most interesting metrics (average loss per day, avg cal consumed, total weight loss); Be careful of total values when time periods are of different lengths; maybe split into two different charts to avoid compare and contrast scenarios; consider just using 2019 data since the older period doesn't have a lot of the more deatiled information.
- exercise: Change total miles ran to average per session, total doesn't mean as much.
- cheat day: Consider flipping the x and y of the chart for consistency with the other charts; For the cheat day visualizations, relax the language about whether cheat days SHOULD be consistent and planned (i.e. it's just info for one person, caveat that).
- tracker: Clarify what the average difference is, not clear if its between actual and predicted or between period 1 and period 2.


Storyboard Questions

Q1: "Does the flow and order of information make sense?"

- Put tracking tool info before cheat days, stronger argument to be made
- otherwise, flow is genreally good
Q2: "Overall, is the story convincing to you?"

- Data is agreeable without any evidence to the contrary, should be taken with a grain of salt because it's just data for one person
- genreally is convincing
