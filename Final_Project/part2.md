# Storyboard (Pre-feedback)
Below is the orginal storyboard I drafted before conducting any feedback interviews.

The storyboard shows the general flow of my story, whereas the wireframes (up next) are the visualization blown up and in more detail.
Generally, I wanted to entice readers with a hook by using some cited statistics about weight loss and obeisity. Then I present my data and let the audience see that it worked for me, so I should be able to extract some features of my routine that made it work. I put these into three categories: the use of exercise, cheat days, and tracking apps.

# User Research

**Goals:**

- Determine if the data is presented clearly and meaning is easy to grasp
- Determine if the visualizations are convincing
- Determine if the meanings of the visualizations contribute meaningfully to the overall objective/call to action
- Determine if the elements of the story are presented logically
- Determine if the reader is convinced by the call to action overall

**Target Audience:** The general public, i.e. anyone. Since anyone can have trouble losing weight, the story needs to be accessible to anyone, regardless of knowledge base.

**Interviewee Selection:** To simulate a wide knowledge base, I chose interviewees among family and peers with a varying degrees of education and knowledge base, some of whom who have tried to lose weight before.

**Visualization/Wireframe Questions**
The following questions will be asked sequentially for each visualization of each wireframe.

**Script and Responses**

Q1: "What does this visualization mean to you?"

In general, all interviewees quickly and correctly identified the meaning of all of the visualizations, except for the initial weight loss summary chart. While I intended for this to give summary information about each period, respondents interpreted it as a compare and contrast scenario between the two periods.

Q2: "How easy is it to determine the meaning of the visualization?"

Consensus of the responses:
- Summary chart: unclear
- Exercise: very easy
- Cheat day: very easy
- Tracker: easy

Q3: "What would make the interpretation of the visualization more clear?"
- Summary Chart: Make the losses positive; Keep only the most interesting metrics (average loss per day, avg cal consumed, total weight loss); Be careful of total values when time periods are of different lengths; maybe split into two different charts to avoid compare and contrast scenarios; consider just using 2019 data since the older period doesn't have a lot of the more deatiled information.
- Exercise: Change total miles ran to average per session, total doesn't mean as much.
- Cheat Day: Consider flipping the x and y of the chart for consistency with the other charts; For the cheat day visualizations, relax the language about whether cheat days SHOULD be consistent and planned (i.e. it's just info for one person, caveat that).
- Tracker: Clarify what the average difference is, not clear if its between actual and predicted or between period 1 and period 2.


Storyboard Questions

Q1: "Does the flow and order of information make sense?"

- Interviewees suggested putting the tracking tool info before the cheat day info since it is a generally stronger argument.
- Otherwise, flow is generally good.

Q2: "Overall, is the story convincing to you?"

- Data is agreeable without any evidence to the contrary, should be taken with a grain of salt because it's just data for one person
- The story is generally convincing.

**Implemented Changes**

General: I made sure each visualization specifies which period's data it is using. A lot of visualization title were changed to be more descriptive and better match the theme.

Summary chart: I completely revised this visual. I kept only three interesting metrics (see the revised version below). I decided to still keep both of the periods in one chart because the metrics I kept were available for both periods, so a compare and contrast scenario becomes more useful. I also refocused the title to stress calorie intake, since all of the metrics it records are based on calories and weight loss as a result. This sort of adds a "lesson" to the orginal three I had: Maintain a calorie deficit.

Exercise: Changed total miles to average miles per session as suggested.

Cheat Days: I changed the language of the titles to better reflect the meaning I am trying to convey. I also added a textual graphic underneath the mood graph that illustrates the connection between mood, motivation, and adherence to goals.

Tracker: I clarified that the average difference is between actual and predicted.

Story Board: Incorporated the visualization changes listed above, and changed the order of the story to present the cheat day visualizations last.

My new story has some significant changes from the original. Aside from the order being changed, I refocused the initial summary chart to focus on calorie intake, so it sort of becomes a fourth lesson in addition to the other three I had before. This serves both purposes by teaching the reader an important lesson while also presenting interesting numbers that will entice the reader.

# Moodboard

![Moodboard](https://jhumes.github.io/Humes-Portfolio/Final_Project/Part2_Sketches/moodboard.png)

Above is my moodboard, which was created in Canva. In general I want to use colors and images focused on blue an orange. They compliment well, and are colorblind friendly. Additionally, many fitness apps such as MyFitnessPal, Elite HRV, etc. use blue themes, so a blue theme on my project might resonate with exercise-oriented users. The font used is Roboto, which is a simple, easy to read font. I think this is best for communicating a clear message. Being overly aesthetic isn't my goal.
