# The Final Data Story

[Visualizing my Weight Loss Habits: What Really Works?](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/visualizing-my-weight-loss-habits/index.html)

## References/Materials Used

The final data story was created in [Shorthand](shorthand.com).
All data visualizations were created using Tableau.
All stock imagery for title backgrounds in the final data story were from [pexels.com](pexels.com), a free stock image website.

## Target Audience

Initially, finding my target audience was relatively easy. Since my project focuses on weight loss, it should be accessible to anyone that could want to lose weight. What was more challenging was presenting the final data story in an easy to understand manner. In general, this involved me cutting down a lot of the verbage in my visualizations as well as in the story itself. For example, instead of describing 2000 calorie per day as the average basal metabolic rate, I described it as the average "break-even point" from an energy perspective. I also found a lot of room for improvement in my titles. At first they were very descriptive, but probably so wordy that they would confuse most people at a glance, so it was a healthy exercise to practice cutting them down to the bare essentials as much as possible.

I also tried to make the story as relatable as possible for the audience. In the text parts of my story, I tried to be short and sweet, and explain what the data meant for the bottom line in terms of weight loss rather than embelishing in cool but unecessary details. I think this comes through in my visualizations, which consist only of simple charts, bar graphs, and line graphs.

## Final Summary

My overall design process stems from many of the same arguments as my target audience. Once I knew I had to construct for a general audience, every design choice I made was influence by that notion. Thus, I made my graph types simple with easy to read information, and kept the language of my story as clear, concise, and informal as possible. One interesting insight is how the interests of my audience might differ from that of my own. During user research, I presented what was initially a summary chart of interesting statistics of my data. However, most of my interviewees voiced that 2/3 of the values on the chart either weren't really interesting to them or didn't relate to weight loss, and I should keep only a select few. This sobered me to the reality that the audience has different expectations that I do. Throughout the construction of my story, I tried to keep this question in my mind: "If I were an audience member, what would I want to see?"

In terms of hard skills that I learned, I felt that making all my visualizations in Tableau was a great learning experience. Even though it wasn't the easiest method available, I became a lot more comfortable with its features. That will hopefully pay dividends in the future given Tableau's rising popularity in the data viz world.
