# About Me
Hello, Reader! My name is Jeremiah Humes, but feel free to call me Jake. I'm a second year student in the Health Care Analytics & IT Program at the Heinz college. My current career aspirations are to be a data scientist or data analyst. After graduation, I hope to work in a public health setting. More generally, I just want to use my data analysis and visualization skills to help people and improve lives.
