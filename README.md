CMU Heinz College - Telling Stories With Data - Fall 2019

# About Me
Hello, Reader! My name is Jeremiah Humes, but feel free to call me Jake. I'm a second year student in the Health Care Analytics & IT Program at the Heinz college. My current career aspirations are to be a data scientist or data analyst. After graduation, I hope to work in a public health setting. More generally, I want to use my data analysis and visualization skills to help people and improve lives.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my SO, playing video games, and outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, or going for a run. My favorite food is shrimp, and I love most things seafood! I also love owls! They are my favorite animal, but I'm a fan of most birds and birds of prey in general.

# What I Hope to Learn in this Class
Before coming to Heinz, I had little exposure to any data analysis/visualization tools beyond the typical Excel. My previous education was in biochemistry, in which proper data visualization techniques and practices were not a focus compared to physical lab techniques. Two issues resulted from this. First, I often feel limited in the tools I have available for data visualization. Second, I often feel unconfident about my choice of data visualization technique, as well as other design choices like color, scale, etc.

Thus, my learning goals for this class are:
- Broaden my horizons of tools available to me for data analysis
- Develop the skill to identify what kinds of visualization techniques are best for certain kinds of data
- Develop the skill to make smart design choices regarding color and other visualization aspects.
