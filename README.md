# Jeremiah Humes - Portfolio
CMU Heinz College - Telling Stories With Data - Fall 2019

# About Me
Hello, Reader! My name is Jeremiah Humes, but feel free to call me Jake. I'm a second year student in the Health Care Analytics & IT Program at the Heinz college. My current career aspirations are to be a data scientist or data analyst. After graduation, I hope to work in a public health setting. More generally, I want to use my data analysis and visualization skills to help people and improve lives.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my SO, playing video games, and outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, or going for a run. My favorite food is shrimp, and I love most things seafood!
